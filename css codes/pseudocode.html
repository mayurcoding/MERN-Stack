    <p id="chat"> This is a paragraph</p>
    <p id="newcss">There are many variations of
        passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority
        have suffered alteration in some form,
        by injected humour, or randomised words
        which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure
        there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet
        tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a
        dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem
        Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected
        humour, or non-characteristic words etc. </p>
