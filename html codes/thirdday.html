<!-- In HTML, **semantic tags** and **non-semantic tags** refer to how well a tag conveys meaning about its content.  

### **1. Semantic Tags**  
Semantic tags clearly define their purpose in a web page. They help both browsers and developers understand the structure of the content.  

**Examples:**  
- `<header>` → Represents the header of a document or a section.  
- `<nav>` → Defines a navigation section.  
- `<section>` → Represents a section of the document.  
- `<article>` → Represents an independent, self-contained content block.  
- `<aside>` → Represents additional content, such as a sidebar.  
- `<footer>` → Represents the footer of a document or a section.  
- `<main>` → Represents the main content of a document.  
- `<figure>` → Represents an image, illustration, or diagram with a caption.  

**Benefits of Semantic Tags:**  
✔ Improves readability of code.  
✔ Enhances SEO (Search Engine Optimization).  
✔ Helps accessibility tools like screen readers.  

---

### **2. Non-Semantic Tags**  
Non-semantic tags do not provide any meaning about their content. They are generic containers used for styling or scripting purposes.  

**Examples:**  
- `<div>` → A generic container used for layout and grouping elements.  
- `<span>` → Used for styling small parts of text or inline elements.  

**Drawbacks of Non-Semantic Tags:**  
❌ Do not provide meaning to content.  
❌ Make the structure harder to understand.  
❌ Less beneficial for SEO and accessibility.  

---

### **Which One to Use?**  
- **Prefer semantic tags** whenever possible for clarity and better SEO.  
- **Use non-semantic tags** when there's no suitable semantic alternative, especially for styling and layout purposes.  

Would you like a practical example demonstrating both? 😊 -->


<!-- ### **What is a `<meta>` tag in HTML?**  
A `<meta>` tag is an **HTML tag** that provides metadata (information about the webpage) 
to browsers and search engines. It is placed inside the `<head>` 
    section of an HTML document.

### **Uses of `<meta>` Tags**
1. **SEO (Search Engine Optimization)**  
   - Helps search engines understand the content of a page.  
2. **Website Performance**  
   - Controls how pages render and behave.  
3. **Social Media Sharing**  
   - Defines how links appear when shared on platforms like Facebook and Twitter.  
4. **Mobile Responsiveness**  
   - Ensures proper display on mobile devices.
